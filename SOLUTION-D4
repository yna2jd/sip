This deliverable was considerably harder than the previous ones. We first began the deliverable having to fix various implementation mistakes with type checking. Whether it was a misunderstanding of SIP as informed by the tests or a simple mistake, the two combined made locating the cause of the errors quite taxing. Unfortunately, while the log files were very helpful with Deliverable 3, they proved less useful for Deliverable 4. We began by implementing arrays. In the meantime, I worked on for loops, trying to follow the tutorial from the Kaleidoscope tutorial's newest version. However, the tutorial introduced Phi functions, which I couldn't get to work properly with the variables SIP has in place. So instead, I remade them to use a modified version of the while loop. As for arrays, the reason we were having so many issues with it turned out to be that we were using the array type. After we used the type of the array, it worked much better. All in all, this was a hard Deliverable and we're glad we can extend TIP for the 5th one.
